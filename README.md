- Pagination for the table to view up to 5 or 10 rows at a time
- Download excel functionality
3. Add Student

## Available Functionalities

You can find routing for each page component provided in the assignment pdf, which includes -
- Signup
- Signin
- ViewStudent
- AddStudent
- Home ( For navigation only ).

I have used Material UI as front-end framework for React components, as it provides seamless integration with React environment.

Side Menu in Dashboard page is for navigating between `view student` and `add student` tabs, which will switch view between two components and display table or form accordingly.

Pagination for student table is available out of the box from the material ui table component.

I hope you find navigating through this website easy and simple.

Thank You,
Shreyas
